Starting with md5---
1 - Find a md5 hash calculator online (here was md5hashgenerator).
2 - Create a file and past the hash in it.
3 - Open John the Ripper to see the options.
4 - verify if you have the list: rockyou.txt
	> locate rockyou.txt
	# I have it in ~/Documents/lists
	# And in /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz
5 - Now we can use John
	> john --format=raw-md5 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz ./passwd.txt
	# it seems to be an issue with the encoding of the rockyou.txt.gz file
	# just use john --format=raw-md5 
	# it will use /usr/share/john/password.lst by default 
	# If you want to use rockyou.txt.gz - unzip it first with gunzip
